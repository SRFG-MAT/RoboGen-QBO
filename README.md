- [OPTIONAL] execute "rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic -r --os=debian:stretch"
- execute "catkin_make" from the workspace to build all packages in the workspace

## steps to create the catkin workspace with ROS
1) mkdir â€“p ~/catkin_ws/src
2) cd ~/catkin_ws/src
3) catkin_init_workspace
4) cd ~/catkin_ws/
5) catkin_make
6) source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
7) echo "source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
8) catkin_create_pkg beginner_tutorials std_msgs rospy roscpp
